      <h2>What's Pong ?</h2>

        <p>If you are living under a rock or very young, you might not know what Pong is.</p>
        <p>
          Pong is a table tennisâ€“themed arcade sports video game, manufactured by Atari and originally released in 1972.
          It was one of the earliest arcade video game ! It was created by Allan Alcorn as a training exercise assigned 
          to him by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell. Pong was the first commercially successful video game, 
          and it helped to establish the video game industry !
        </p>
        <p>
          Pong is a two-dimensional sport game that simulates table-tennis. The player controls an in-game paddle 
          by moving it vertically across the left or right side of the screen. They can compete against another 
          player controlling a second paddle on the opposing side. Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth. 
          The goal is for each player to reach eleven points before the opponent, points are earned when one fails 
          to return the ball to the other.

      <h2>Ok, nice history lesson but what's is this website for ?</h2>
      <p>On this website, we've tried our best to reproduce the same pong from 1972!
        Because it can be nice sometimes to discover or re-discover the first video game, 
        it's a piece of history after all !
      </p>
      <p>
        But because sometime we don't have time for an eleven point game, You can choose in how many 
        points to play the game. To move your paddle up, use the [W] key and [S] key to move down, 
        simple as that ! You can ask another player to play with you or wait in a queue and 
        be match with another random user waiting to play !
